Learn how to set up a new deployment on Cube Cloud using a sample database.

This guide will walk you through the following tasks:

- [Create a new deployment](/getting-started/cloud/create-a-deployment)
- [Generate models from a connected data source](/getting-started/cloud/generate-models)
- [Query Cube using the Developer Playground and APIs](/getting-started/cloud/query-cube)
- [Add a pre-aggregation to optimize query performance](/getting-started/cloud/add-a-pre-aggregation)

If you'd prefer to run Cube locally, then you can refer to [Getting Started
using Cube Core][ref-getting-started-core-overview] instead.
