Cube Cloud offers a variety of deployment types to meet your requirements. We
provide a generous free tier to get you started, and offer flexible paid plans
to suit your growing business requirements.

## Development Instance

Development Instances are designed for development use-cases only. This allows
getting set up with Cube Cloud simply and easily, and also allows you to build
and query pre-aggregations on-demand.

Development Instances hibernate after 60 minutes of inactivity; the first
request to the Development Instance after hibernation may take additional time
to process.

## Production Cluster

<InfoBox>

Later this year, Cube Store will replace Redis. Read more about in [on the
blog][cube-blog-replace-redis].

</InfoBox>

Production Clusters are designed for production workloads. A Production Cluster
includes the following components:

- 1x Cube API instance
- 1x Cube Store Workers
- 1x Redis instance for caching and queueing

- Autoscaling for Cube API instances (?)
- Load balancing for multi-tenant deployments (?)

## Production Multi-Cluster

<InfoBox>

This deployment type is only available on **Enterprise Premium** plans.

</InfoBox>

Cube Cloud also allows you to deploy multiple Production Clusters for an
application. Each additional cluster is charged separately.

## Additional Infrastructure

Cube Cloud also allows adding additional infrastructure to your deployment to
increase scalability and performance beyond the default limits of the Premium
plan.

### Cube Store Worker

|                         | Starter | Premium | Enterprise | Enterprise Premium |
| ----------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :--------: | :----------------: |
| Storage size per worker |  150GB  |  150GB  |   150GB    |       Custom       |

Cube Store Workers are used to build and persist pre-aggregations. Each Worker
has a maximum of 150GB of storage; additional Cube Store workers can be added to
your deployment to both increase storage space and improve pre-aggregation
performance.

### Cube API Instance

|                      | Starter | Premium | Enterprise | Enterprise Premium |
| -------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :--------: | :----------------: |
| API requests per day | 10,000  | 200,000 | Unlimited  |     Unlimited      |

Cube API instances are rate-limited, based on your subscription plan. Additional
Cube API instances can be added to your deployment to increase the throughput of
your queries.

## Pricing

Each deployment type is charged by compute units per hour.

<InfoBox heading="What's a credit?">

A **Compute Unit** is a virtual unit of currency representing the cost of
running Cube Cloud infrastructure. The price of a compute unit is determined by
the Cube Cloud plan you're subscribed to.

</InfoBox>

| Node Type                 | Compute Unit per hour |
| ------------------------- | :-------------------: |
| Cube Production Cluster   |          `4`          |
| Cube Development Instance |          `1`          |
| Cube Store Worker         |          `1`          |
| Cube API Instance         |          `1`          |

|                              | Starter | Premium | Enterprise | Enterprise Premium |
| ---------------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :--------: | :----------------: |
| Cost per 1 Cube Compute Unit |  $XXX   |  $XXX   |    $XXX    |        $XXX        |

Your pricing plan and units from the table above determine the features,
scalability, and availability of your deployment.

## Switching between deployment types

To switch a deployment's type, go to the deployment's settings page and select
from the available options:
